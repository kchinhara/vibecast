# Georgist Terms and Concepts Glossary

## Core Economic Terms

### Economic Rent
- **Definition**: Payment for use of land and natural resources
- **NOT**: Apartment rent (which includes building costs)
- **Key Point**: Created by community/location, not landowner effort
- **Example**: A parking lot in Manhattan vs. rural Kansas

### Land (Economic Definition)
- **Includes**: All natural resources and opportunities
- **Examples**: 
  - Physical land
  - Oil, minerals, water
  - Electromagnetic spectrum
  - Orbital positions
  - Even fishing rights
- **NOT**: Buildings or improvements

### Single Tax
- **What**: Tax only on land values, no other taxes
- **Rate**: Ideally approaches 100% of annual rental value
- **Effect**: Makes holding idle land expensive
- **Result**: Land used efficiently or sold to someone who will

### Land Value Tax (LVT)
- **Modern Term**: For partial implementation of George's ideas
- **Difference**: Usually combined with other taxes
- **Assessment**: Value of land without improvements
- **Examples**: Pennsylvania cities, Denmark, Singapore

### Unearned Increment
- **Definition**: Increase in land value from community growth
- **Example**: Farmland becoming valuable when city expands
- **George's Point**: This belongs to community that created it

### Economic Rent vs. Contract Rent
- **Economic Rent**: What land itself commands
- **Contract Rent**: What tenant pays (includes building, services)
- **Example**: $3000/month apartment might be $2000 building + $1000 land

## Georgist Principles

### Ricardo's Law of Rent
- **Statement**: Rent equals productive advantage over marginal land
- **Marginal Land**: Least productive land in use that pays no rent
- **Implication**: As margin extends, all better land's rent rises

### Law of Wages
- **George's Formula**: Wages = Product - Rent
- **Implication**: Rising rents reduce wages
- **Modern Example**: Tech workers' high salaries eaten by Bay Area rents

### ATCOR (All Taxes Come Out of Rent)
- **Concept**: Taxes ultimately reduce land values
- **Example**: High property taxes = lower land prices
- **Implication**: Shifting taxes to land is neutral to landowners

### EBCOR (Excess Burden Comes Out of Rent)
- **Concept**: Deadweight loss of bad taxes reduces land values
- **Example**: Income taxes discourage work, lowering land productivity
- **Implication**: Removing bad taxes increases land values

## Movement Terms

### Georgism
- **Definition**: Economic philosophy based on George's ideas
- **Core Belief**: Land and natural resources belong to all
- **Solution**: Capture land rent for public benefit

### Geoism
- **Alternative Term**: Emphasizes earth/land aspect
- **Usage**: More common in environmental contexts

### Single Taxers
- **Definition**: Advocates of George's full program
- **Historical**: Most active 1880-1920
- **Modern**: Fewer pure single taxers, more LVT advocates

### Land Value Capture
- **Definition**: Public recovery of land value increases
- **Methods**: Tax, lease, public ownership
- **Examples**: Hong Kong land leases, value capture around transit

### Split-Rate Tax
- **Definition**: Higher tax rate on land than buildings
- **Purpose**: Incentivize development, discourage speculation
- **Examples**: Pittsburgh (1913-2001), Harrisburg, PA

## Modern Applications

### Congestion Pricing
- **Georgist Principle**: Pay for exclusive use of scarce resource
- **Application**: Road space in cities
- **Examples**: London, Singapore, New York

### Carbon Tax
- **Georgist Logic**: Atmosphere is common property
- **Application**: Charge for dumping carbon into commons
- **George Compatible**: Yes, it's rent on atmospheric space

### Spectrum Auctions
- **Resource**: Electromagnetic spectrum
- **Georgist View**: Public resource, rent should be captured
- **Modern Practice**: Partial implementation through auctions

### Land Banking
- **Practice**: Hold land vacant waiting for appreciation
- **Georgist Solution**: High land taxes make this unprofitable
- **Effect**: Forces productive use or sale

### Universal Basic Income (UBI)
- **Georgist Version**: Funded by land rent (Citizen's Dividend)
- **Justification**: Everyone owns equal share of earth
- **Different from**: General UBI funded by other taxes

## Economic Effects

### Sprawl
- **Cause**: Land speculation in cities pushes development out
- **Georgist Solution**: Tax idle urban land into use
- **Result**: Compact, efficient cities

### Boom-Bust Cycles
- **George's Insight**: Land speculation drives cycles
- **Pattern**: Credit → Land bubble → Crash → Recession
- **Solution**: Stable land values through LVT

### Affordable Housing Crisis
- **Root Cause**: Land costs, not construction costs
- **Evidence**: Building costs similar everywhere, land varies
- **Solution**: LVT reduces land prices

### Wealth Inequality
- **Land's Role**: Major component of wealth concentration
- **Inheritance**: Land wealth passes between generations
- **Solution**: Public capture of land values

## Implementation Terms

### Site Value Rating
- **Definition**: Australian/NZ term for land value tax
- **Practice**: Local councils rate land not buildings
- **Effect**: Encourages development

### Graded Tax
- **Definition**: Gradual shift from building to land tax
- **Purpose**: Smooth transition
- **Example**: Reduce building tax 10% yearly, increase land tax

### Highest and Best Use
- **Definition**: Most profitable legal use of land
- **LVT Effect**: Forces land toward this use
- **Result**: Efficient land allocation

### Improvements
- **Definition**: Human-made additions to land
- **Examples**: Buildings, landscaping, infrastructure
- **Tax Treatment**: Should not be taxed under George

### Assessment
- **Challenge**: Separating land from improvement value
- **Methods**: Comparable sales, residual method
- **Modern Tools**: GIS, mass appraisal techniques

## Common Misconceptions

### "Georgism is Communism"
- **False**: George supported private property in improvements
- **True**: Only land would be socially owned (via tax)

### "Single Tax means one tax rate"
- **False**: Means only one type of tax (on land)
- **True**: Rate varies by land value

### "It would destroy farming"
- **False**: Farm land has low value per acre
- **True**: Urban land would bear most tax

### "No one would improve property"
- **False**: Improvements wouldn't be taxed
- **True**: Strong incentive to develop

### "It's never been tried"
- **False**: Partial implementations worldwide
- **True**: Never fully implemented at national scale
