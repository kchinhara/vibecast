# Henry George Research Notes

## Overview
Henry George (1839-1897) was an American political economist and journalist whose ideas on land, labor, and capital fundamentally challenged the economic thinking of his time. His most famous work, "Progress and Poverty" (1879), became one of the best-selling books of the 19th century.

## Core Economic Theories

### The Central Paradox: Progress and Poverty
George's fundamental observation was that technological and economic progress seemed to increase poverty rather than reduce it. He asked: "Why, in spite of increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living?"

### Theory of Economic Rent
1. **Definition**: Economic rent is the return to land ownership, distinct from returns to labor and capital
2. **Key Insight**: Land values are created by the community, not individual landowners
3. **Rent Formula**: Rent = Total Production - (Wages + Interest)
4. **Location Value**: Prime locations command higher rents due to community development

### The Three Factors of Production
1. **Land**: All natural resources and opportunities
2. **Labor**: All human exertion in production
3. **Capital**: Wealth used to produce more wealth

### The Law of Rent
- Also known as "Ricardo's Law of Rent" (though George refined it)
- Rent equals the advantage of the most productive land over the least productive land in use
- As society progresses, the margin of production is pushed to less productive land
- This increases rent on all better land

### Wages and Interest
- **Wages**: The return to labor
- **Interest**: The return to capital
- George argued both were determined by what labor could produce on marginal (rent-free) land
- As rent increases, wages and interest are squeezed

## The Single Tax

### Concept
- Government should finance all operations through a single tax on land values
- This tax would capture the economic rent for public use
- All other taxes (on labor, capital, sales, etc.) should be abolished

### Justification
1. **Moral**: Land is a common heritage; private land rent is theft from the community
2. **Economic**: Taxing land values doesn't reduce productivity (unlike other taxes)
3. **Practical**: Land cannot be hidden or moved; easy to assess and collect

### Expected Benefits
- End land speculation
- Reduce inequality
- Increase productivity by removing taxes on labor and capital
- Make land more accessible to productive users
- Fund public services without deadweight loss

## Progress and Poverty (1879)

### Structure
1. **Book I**: Wages and Capital
2. **Book II**: Population and Subsistence
3. **Book III**: The Laws of Distribution
4. **Book IV**: Effect of Material Progress on the Distribution of Wealth
5. **Book V**: The Problem Solved
6. **Book VI**: The Remedy
7. **Book VII**: Justice of the Remedy
8. **Book VIII**: Application of the Remedy
9. **Book IX**: Effects of the Remedy
10. **Book X**: The Law of Human Progress

### Key Arguments
1. **Wages Fund Theory Refutation**: Demolished the prevailing theory that wages came from capital
2. **Malthusian Theory Critique**: Argued poverty wasn't due to overpopulation
3. **True Cause of Poverty**: Land monopoly and rent extraction
4. **Solution**: Socialization of land rent through taxation

### Revolutionary Ideas
- Labor creates all wealth
- Capital is simply stored-up labor
- Land speculation causes economic cycles
- Free trade in everything except land ownership

## Georgism Movement

### Early Movement (1880s-1920s)
- Single Tax clubs formed worldwide
- Influenced Progressive Era reforms
- Several experimental communities founded
- Strong support among workers and reformers

### Political Influence
- **United Kingdom**: Liberal Party land reform campaigns
- **Australia**: Significant influence on labor movement
- **Denmark**: Grundskyld (land value tax) partially implemented
- **United States**: Progressive movement adoption of ideas

### Key Followers
- **Leo Tolstoy**: Called George's ideas "true and indisputable"
- **Winston Churchill**: Early supporter of land value taxation
- **Sun Yat-sen**: Incorporated Georgist ideas into Chinese nationalism
- **Albert Einstein**: Praised George's economic analysis

## Modern Applications

### Contemporary Land Value Tax Examples
1. **Singapore**: Significant land value capture for public benefit
2. **Hong Kong**: Land lease system inspired by George
3. **Pennsylvania cities**: Several implemented split-rate property tax
4. **Denmark**: National land value tax since 1920s
5. **Taiwan**: Sun Yat-sen's Georgist influence in land reform

### Modern Georgist Organizations
- Henry George Foundation (UK)
- Robert Schalkenbach Foundation (US)
- International Union for Land Value Taxation
- Center for the Study of Economics
- Prosper Australia

### Digital Age Applications
- Spectrum rights (electromagnetic "land")
- Domain names and digital real estate
- Platform monopolies as "digital landlords"
- Carbon tax as Georgist principle
- Congestion pricing for urban space

## Key Concepts for Animation

### Visual Metaphors
1. **The Wedge**: How rent drives between labor and its full product
2. **The Pyramid**: Wealth concentration through land monopoly
3. **The Rising Tide**: Progress lifting land values, not wages
4. **The Monopoly Board**: Land speculation as a game
5. **The Commons**: Land as shared inheritance

### Economic Cycles
- Land speculation → Rising prices → Bubble → Crash → Depression
- George predicted this pattern before modern business cycle theory

### Social Physics
- George saw economics as following natural laws like physics
- Progress creates pressure that must go somewhere
- If captured by land rent, creates poverty

### The Cat Paradox
- George's famous example: Why do cats have no exchange value despite being useful?
- Because they're not monopolized like land

## Criticisms and Debates

### Economic Criticisms
1. **Sufficiency Question**: Would land tax revenue be enough for modern government?
2. **Assessment Challenges**: Difficulty in separating land from improvement values
3. **Capital Mobility**: Modern capital can flee jurisdictions
4. **Political Feasibility**: Entrenched interests oppose change

### Theoretical Debates
- Role of entrepreneurship in creating value
- Whether all monopolies derive from land monopoly
- Relationship between rent and interest rates
- Impact on economic development incentives

### Modern Relevance
- Housing affordability crisis validates George's insights
- Tech billionaires discovering Georgism (e.g., Sam Altman)
- Climate change making land use crucial
- Urban planning incorporating value capture
