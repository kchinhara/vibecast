# Key Visual Concepts for Henry George Animation

## Core Visual Metaphors

### 1. The Land Value Gradient
- **Concept**: Show how land values increase from rural margins to city centers
- **Visual**: 3D topographic map where height = land value
- **Animation**: As city grows, the "mountain" of land values rises
- **Key Point**: Individual effort doesn't create location value

### 2. The Three-Factor Pie
- **Concept**: Total wealth divided between Land, Labor, and Capital
- **Visual**: Animated pie chart showing changing proportions
- **Animation**: As progress occurs, Land's slice grows, squeezing Labor and Capital
- **Key Point**: Rising rents capture the gains from progress

### 3. The Speculation Spiral
- **Concept**: How land speculation creates boom-bust cycles
- **Visual**: Spiral ascending then crashing
- **Animation Sequence**:
  1. Productive use creates value
  2. Speculators buy and hold land idle
  3. Prices rise beyond productive value
  4. Crash when speculation unsustainable
  5. Depression until cycle repeats

### 4. The Commons Tree
- **Concept**: Land as common inheritance bearing fruit
- **Visual**: Tree with roots in "common ground"
- **Animation**: 
  - Without private capture: Fruit feeds all equally
  - With private capture: Fence appears, fruit hoarded
- **Key Point**: Natural resources belong to all

### 5. The Wedge of Rent
- **Concept**: Rent drives a wedge between workers and their product
- **Visual**: Literal wedge splitting production from wages
- **Animation**: As wedge grows, less reaches workers
- **Key Point**: Explains why progress doesn't reduce poverty

## Character Representations

### Henry George Character Design
- **Young George**: Sailor/adventurer, optimistic but questioning
- **Poverty Period**: Gaunt, desperate, holding hungry child
- **Eureka Moment**: Eyes wide, light bulb/sunburst effect
- **Writer George**: Intense, surrounded by papers and books
- **Speaker George**: Commanding, addressing massive crowds

### Supporting Characters
- **The Landlord**: Top hat, collecting rent while doing nothing
- **The Worker**: Producing goods but receiving less and less
- **The Speculator**: Holding empty land, waiting for prices to rise

## Economic Mechanics Visualizations

### 1. Ricardo's Law of Rent
- **Setup**: Series of land plots from best to worst
- **Animation**: 
  1. Start with only best land in use
  2. Population grows, cultivation extends to worse land
  3. Rent appears on better land = productivity difference
  4. Show rent rising on all plots as margin extends

### 2. The Production Function
- **Visual**: Factory/workshop producing goods
- **Three Inputs Flowing In**:
  - Land (natural resources)
  - Labor (workers)
  - Capital (tools/machines)
- **Output**: Total production
- **Distribution**: Show how output is divided

### 3. Tax Comparison
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**:
  - Current system: Multiple tax collectors taking from production
  - Single Tax: One collector taking only land rent
- **Show Effects**:
  - Current: Production shrinks, complexity
  - Single Tax: Production thrives, simplicity

### 4. Land Value Creation
- **Community Building Scene**:
  - Empty plot in center
  - Community builds roads, schools, businesses around it
  - Central plot value rises without owner effort
  - Question mark: "Who created this value?"
