# Supply & Demand Animation Storyboard

## Animation Title: "The Market Dance"
**Duration**: 20 seconds
**Target Audience**: Economics beginners
**Learning Objective**: Understand how supply and demand interact to determine price

---

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Market Introduction (0-3s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Animated marketplace with vendors (suppliers) on left
- Buyers (demanders) entering from right
- Products displayed: apples with price tags
- Background: Simple, clean market setting

**Animation**:
- Vendors arranging products (0-1s)
- Buyers walking in with shopping bags (1-2s)
- Focus zoom on apple stand (2-3s)

**Audio**: "In every market, sellers want to sell..."

**Cognitive Load**: Low - familiar setting

---

### Scene 2: Supply Curve Formation (3-7s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Graph appears with price (Y) and quantity (X) axes
- Vendors transform into dots on graph
- Dots connect to form upward-sloping supply curve
- Color: Blue for supply

**Animation**:
- Axes draw themselves (3-4s)
- Vendors morph into data points (4-5s)
- Points connect with smooth line (5-6s)
- Label appears: "SUPPLY" (6-7s)

**Audio**: "...at higher prices, sellers offer more"

**Cognitive Load**: Medium - abstract concept introduction

---

### Scene 3: Demand Curve Formation (7-11s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Same graph framework
- Buyers transform into dots
- Dots form downward-sloping demand curve
- Color: Red for demand

**Animation**:
- Buyers morph into data points (7-8s)
- Points connect with smooth line (8-9s)
- Label appears: "DEMAND" (9-10s)
- Both curves visible together (10-11s)

**Audio**: "...while buyers want more at lower prices"

**Cognitive Load**: Medium - building on previous concept

---

### Scene 4: Finding Equilibrium (11-15s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Intersection point glows
- Price and quantity lines extend to axes
- Equilibrium values highlight
- Market clears animation

**Animation**:
- Curves approach each other (11-12s)
- Intersection point pulses with glow (12-13s)
- Dotted lines extend to axes (13-14s)
- "EQUILIBRIUM" label appears (14-15s)

**Audio**: "They meet at the equilibrium price"

**Cognitive Load**: High - synthesis of concepts

---

### Scene 5: Real-World Application (15-20s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Split screen: graph and market
- Transactions happening at equilibrium price
- Happy vendors and buyers
- Quantity sold matches equilibrium

**Animation**:
- Return to market scene (15-16s)
- Transactions at equilibrium price (16-18s)
- Graph shows stability (18-19s)
- Success indicators appear (19-20s)

**Audio**: "Where everyone gets what they need!"

**Cognitive Load**: Low - reinforcement through application

---

## Interactive Elements

### Engagement Points:
1. **Pause Point 1** (7s): "What happens when price goes up?"
2. **Pause Point 2** (11s): "Where will they meet?"
3. **Click Interaction** (15s): "Try changing the price!"

### Post-Animation Quiz:
- Q1: "Which way does the supply curve slope?"
- Q2: "What happens at equilibrium?"
- Q3: "If price is too high, what occurs?"
