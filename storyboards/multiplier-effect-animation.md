# Multiplier Effect Animation Storyboard

## Animation Title: "The Ripple Effect"
**Duration**: 25 seconds
**Target Audience**: Intermediate economics students
**Learning Objective**: Understand how initial spending creates larger economic impact

---

## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Initial Injection (0-4s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Government building at center
- $1000 appears as golden coins
- Construction worker receives payment
- Ripple effect visualization begins

**Animation**:
- Government building appears (0-1s)
- Coins drop from building (1-2s)
- Worker catches coins with smile (2-3s)
- Subtle ripple emanates outward (3-4s)

**Audio**: "When government spends $1000..."

**Cognitive Load**: Low - concrete visual metaphor

---

### Scene 2: First Round of Spending (4-8s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Worker at grocery store
- $800 spent (80% of $1000)
- $200 saved (piggy bank visual)
- Store owner receives money

**Animation**:
- Worker walks to store (4-5s)
- Money splits: 80% to store, 20% to piggy bank (5-6s)
- Store owner counts money happily (6-7s)
- Ripple grows larger (7-8s)

**Audio**: "The worker spends 80%, saves 20%"

**Cognitive Load**: Medium - introducing MPC concept

---

### Scene 3: Second Round (8-12s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Store owner at restaurant
- $640 spent (80% of $800)
- $160 saved
- Restaurant owner receives

**Animation**:
- Store owner enters restaurant (8-9s)
- Money splits again: 80/20 (9-10s)
- Restaurant owner receives payment (10-11s)
- Ripple effect intensifies (11-12s)

**Audio**: "The store owner also spends 80%..."

**Cognitive Load**: Medium - pattern recognition

---

### Scene 4: Cascade Visualization (12-17s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Split screen showing multiple rounds
- Decreasing amounts: $512, $410, $328...
- Running total counter
- Visual representation of geometric series

**Animation**:
- Multiple spending rounds simultaneously (12-14s)
- Money amounts shrinking but accumulating (14-15s)
- Total counter rapidly increasing (15-16s)
- Formula appears: 1/(1-MPC) (16-17s)

**Audio**: "Each round gets smaller, but adds up!"

**Cognitive Load**: High - mathematical concept

---

### Scene 5: Final Impact (17-22s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Original $1000 vs final $5000 impact
- 5x multiplier visualization
- Economy-wide benefits shown
- Jobs, growth indicators

**Animation**:
- Zoom out to show entire economy (17-18s)
- $1000 transforms to $5000 (18-19s)
- Multiple happy businesses/workers (19-21s)
- "5X MULTIPLIER!" appears (21-22s)

**Audio**: "Creating 5 times the original impact!"

**Cognitive Load**: Medium - synthesis and application

---

### Scene 6: Formula Recap (22-25s)
**Visual Elements**:
- Clean formula presentation
- Multiplier = 1/(1-MPC)
- If MPC = 0.8, then Multiplier = 5
- Real-world applications listed

**Animation**:
- Formula builds step by step (22-23s)
- Example calculation shown (23-24s)
- Applications appear as icons (24-25s)

**Audio**: "The multiplier formula in action"

**Cognitive Load**: Low - reinforcement

---

## Interactive Elements

### Slider Interactions:
1. **MPC Adjuster** (after video): Change savings rate to see multiplier change
2. **Initial Amount** slider: See how different injections create different totals
3. **Speed Control**: Slow down cascade section for clarity

### Comprehension Checks:
- "If people save more, what happens to the multiplier?"
- "Calculate the multiplier if MPC = 0.9"
- "Why doesn't the money multiply infinitely?"

## Visual Design System

### Color Coding:
- Government spending: Gold (#FFD700)
- Consumer spending: Green (#2ECC71)
- Savings: Blue (#3498DB)
- Multiplier effect: Purple (#9B59B6)
- Background: Gradient (#ECF0F1 to #BDC3C7)

### Visual Metaphors:
- Ripples in water for economic impact
- Piggy banks for savings
- Flowing arrows for money movement
- Growing circles for cumulative effect

### Mathematical Visualization:
- Geometric series as shrinking bars
- Running total with counter
- Formula assembly animation
- Interactive graph overlay

---

## Cognitive Load Management

### Complexity Scaffolding:
1. Start with concrete (physical money exchange)
2. Introduce pattern (repeated 80/20 split)
3. Show mathematical relationship
4. Return to real-world impact

### Repetition Strategy:
- 80/20 split shown 3 times minimum
- Multiplier concept stated 4 ways
- Formula presented twice

### Chunking:
- 4-5 second segments per concept
- Clear transitions between ideas
- Visual breaks between complex sections

---

## Assessment Integration

### Formative Checks:
- Pause at 8s: "What will happen next?"
- Interactive at 17s: "Calculate the total"
- Reflection at 25s: "When else might this apply?"

### Performance Indicators:
- Slider interaction time
- Calculation accuracy
- Concept application success
- Transfer to new scenarios
