# 🌍 Henry George Economics - Interactive Educational Animations

An interactive educational platform that explains the revolutionary economic theories of Henry George through engaging animations and simulations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project brings 19th-century economist Henry George's insights about land, labor, and capital to life through modern web animations. George's work "Progress and Poverty" (1879) explained why poverty persists despite technological progress - a question even more relevant today.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the animations.

## 📚 Educational Modules

### 1. **Land Value Gradient** 🏔️
- Visualizes how location creates value
- Shows community infrastructure raising land values
- Demonstrates that landowners capture publicly-created wealth

### 2. **The Rent Wedge** 🔺
- Illustrates how rent drives a wedge between workers and their product
- Shows why wages stay low despite rising productivity
- Explains the fundamental cause of inequality

### 3. **Three Factors of Production** 🥧
- Interactive timeline from 1800 to present
- Shows how land captures ever-increasing share of wealth
- "What if?" mode demonstrates Single Tax alternative

### 4. **Land Value Tax Simulator** 🏗️
- Interactive city builder
- Compare current tax system vs Single Tax
- See real-time effects on development, speculation, and prosperity

## 🎨 Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with ES6 modules
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Animation**: GSAP (GreenSock)
- **Styling**: CSS Grid & Flexbox
- **Interactivity**: Custom event system

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### Economic Rent
The payment for use of land and natural resources. George showed this captures value created by the community, not the landowner.

### Single Tax
George's proposal to fund government entirely through land value taxation, eliminating taxes on labor and capital.

### The Three Factors
- **Land**: Natural resources and location
- **Labor**: Human effort and creativity  
- **Capital**: Tools, machines, and improvements

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. Start with **Land Value Gradient** to understand how location creates value
2. Move to **Rent Wedge** to see why workers get less as society progresses
3. Explore **Three Factors** to track historical wealth distribution
4. Use **LVT Simulator** to experiment with solutions
