# Assessment Framework for Economic Animation Learning

## 1. Assessment Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Formative over Summative**: Continuous feedback during learning
- **Understanding over Memorization**: Test application, not recall
- **Immediate Feedback**: Learn from mistakes instantly
- **Multiple Attempts**: Encourage exploration without penalty
- **Contextual Assessment**: Real-world problem solving

## 2. Assessment Types by Cognitive Level

### A. Knowledge Level (Remember & Understand)
**Duration**: 5-10 seconds per question
**Cognitive Load**: Low

#### Quick Checks
```
After Supply/Demand animation:
Q: "When price increases, quantity supplied..."
A) Increases ✓
B) Decreases
C) Stays the same

Feedback: "Correct! Suppliers want to sell more at higher prices."
```

#### Visual Recognition
```
Show graph:
Q: "Identify the demand curve"
[Click on correct curve]

Feedback with visual highlight
```

### B. Application Level (Apply & Analyze)
**Duration**: 15-30 seconds per question
**Cognitive Load**: Medium

#### Scenario Problems
```
Scenario: "Coffee crop failure in Brazil"
Q: "What happens to coffee prices?"

Interactive graph shows:
- Supply curve shifting left
- New equilibrium point
- Price increase visualization
```

#### Predictive Exercises
```
Given: Interest rates increase by 2%
Predict impacts on:
- [ ] Investment
- [ ] Savings
- [ ] Consumption
- [ ] Currency value

Show results with explanations
```

### C. Synthesis Level (Evaluate & Create)
**Duration**: 45-60 seconds per question
**Cognitive Load**: High

#### Policy Design Challenges
```
Challenge: "Design fiscal policy for recession"
Tools available:
- Tax rate adjuster
- Spending level selector
- See real-time GDP impact

Success criteria shown
Multiple valid solutions
```

## 3. Embedded Assessment Strategies

### A. Pause-and-Predict
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// At key moments in animation
animation.pause();
showQuestion("What happens next?");
collectPrediction();
animation.resume();
comparePredictionToResult();
```

**Example Moments**:
- Before equilibrium is reached
- Before showing economic impact
- Before revealing multiplier effect

### B. Interactive Checkpoints
**Design Pattern**:
1. Present partial information
2. Ask for completion/correction
3. Provide scaffolded hints
4. Show correct solution
5. Explain reasoning

### C. Branching Scenarios
```
Initial Choice: "As Fed Chair, inflation is rising. You..."
├── Raise interest rates
│   └── "By how much?" [0.25% / 0.5% / 0.75%]
│       └── Show different economic outcomes
├── Keep rates steady
│   └── "Explain your reasoning"
│       └── Compare to historical examples
└── Lower rates
    └── "Unconventional! What's your strategy?"
        └── Explore alternative theories
```

## 4. Progress Tracking System

### A. Concept Mastery Grid
```
Economic Concepts Progress:
┌─────────────────────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┐
│ Concept             │ Videos │ Quizzes │ Mastery│
├─────────────────────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┤
│ Supply & Demand     │ 3/3 ✓  │ 8/10    │ 85%    │
│ Elasticity          │ 2/4    │ 5/8     │ 62%    │
│ Market Structures   │ 1/5    │ 2/6     │ 40%    │
│ Monetary Policy     │ 0/3    │ 0/5     │ 0%     │
└─────────────────────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┘
```

### B. Skill Development Radar
```

## 5. Adaptive Assessment Engine

### A. Difficulty Algorithm
```python
def adjust_difficulty(user_performance):
    if user_performance.accuracy < 0.6:
        return {
            'reduce_complexity': True,
            'add_hints': True,
            'slow_pace': True
        }
    elif user_performance.accuracy > 0.9:
        return {
            'increase_complexity': True,
            'add_extensions': True,
            'introduce_edge_cases': True
        }
```

### B. Personalized Question Banks
- **Weakness targeting**: More questions on struggling areas
- **Strength building**: Advanced challenges in mastered areas
- **Spaced repetition**: Review cycle based on forgetting curve
- **Context variety**: Same concept, different scenarios

## 6. Feedback Design Patterns

### A. Immediate Feedback Types

#### Corrective Feedback
```
Your answer: "Demand increases"
Correct answer: "Demand decreases"

Here's why: When price rises, buyers want less,
not more. The demand curve shows quantity 
demanded at each price, not the curve shifting.
[Show animation of movement along curve]
```

#### Elaborative Feedback
```
Correct! And here's something interesting:
This concept explains why luxury goods sometimes
break this rule (Veblen goods).

```

### B. Peer Assessment
1. Students create their own quiz questions
2. Trade with partners
3. Solve each other's problems
4. Discuss different approaches
5. Rate question quality
